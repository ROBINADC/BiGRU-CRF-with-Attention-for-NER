"stefano bordon is out through illness and coste said he had dropped back row corrado covi , who had been recalled for the england game after five years out of the national team .",
"cuttitta announced his retirement after the 1995 world cup , where he took issue with being dropped from the italy side that faced england in the pool stages .",

two goals in the last six minutes gave holders japan an uninspiring 2-1 asian cup victory over syria on friday .,

rugby union - little to miss campese farewell .,
robert kitson,
london 1996-12-06,
centre jason little will miss australia 's end-of-tour fixture against the barbarians at twickenham on saturday .,
little has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow queenslander daniel herbert .,
owen finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend 's test against wales and retains his place in the back-row ahead of daniel manu .,
the wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their european tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide david campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in australian colours .,
"the wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic .",
"campese will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of barbarians captain rob andrew , the man who kicked australia to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the world cup quarter-final in cape town .",
""" campo has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 , "" said andrew , also likely to be making his final twickenham appearance .",
"on tour , australia have won all four tests against italy , scotland , ireland and wales , and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game .",
"league duties restricted the barbarians ' selectorial options but they still boast 13 internationals including england full-back tim stimpson and recalled wing tony underwood , plus all black forwards ian jones and norm hewitt .",

melbourne 1996-12-06,
australia gave brian lara another reason to be miserable when they beat west indies by five wickets in the opening world series limited overs match on friday .,
"lara , disciplined for misconduct on wednesday , was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour .",
"australia , who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series , overhauled west indies ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats .",
"all-rounder greg blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd .",
man-of-the match blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes .,
"his crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder stuart law , who scored 21 , added 71 off 85 balls .",
lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to shane warne at mid-wicket .,
west indies tour manager clive lloyd has apologised for lara 's behaviour on tuesday .,
he ( lara ) had told australia coach geoff marsh that wicketkeeper ian healy was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room .,
"the melbourne crowd were clearly angered by the incident , loudly jeering the west indies vice-captain as he walked to the middle .",
it was left to fellow left-hander shivnarine chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin .,
chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out .,

melbourne 1996-12-06,
"west indies batsman brian lara suffered another blow to his australian tour , after already being disciplined for misconduct , when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against australia on friday .",
"lara , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against australia wicketkeeper ian healy , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat .",
the west indies vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer tom moody straight to shane warne at mid-wicket .,
west indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the melbourne cricket ground after captain courtney walsh won the toss and elected to bat .,
lara 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the australian public against him .,
as he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd .,
"on several occasions during his innings , the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him .",
tour manager clive lloyd on wednesday apologised for lara 's behaviour in confronting australia coach geoff marsh in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on tuesday .,
lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take .,
"lara , who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about healy 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the australia keeper .",
australia went on to win the match at the sydney cricket ground by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after lara failed in both innings .,
lara has yet to score a century since west indies arrived in australia five weeks ago .,
"both west indies and australia team management have played down the incident , stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected .",

the loss by philadelphia allowed the idle green bay packers ( 10-3 ) to clinch the first nfc playoff berth .,
"the colts won despite the absence of injured starting defensive tackle tony siragusa , cornerback ray buchanan and linebacker quentin coryatt .",
"faulk carried 16 times , including a 13-yard td run in the first quarter and a seven-yard score early in the final period .",
"justin made his second straight start for harbaugh , who has a knee injury .",
justin suffered a sprained right shoulder in the third quarter and did not return .,
"third-stringer kerwin bell , a 1988 draft choice of the miami dolphins , made his nfl debut and was 5-of-5 for 75 yards , including a 20-yard scoring strike to marvin harrison in the third period .",
a 39-yard interference penalty against philadelphia 's troy vincent set up faulk 's first score around left end that capped an 80-yard march 5:17 into the game and the rout was on .,
eagles quarterback ty detmer was 17-of-34 for 182 yards before he was benched .,

interview-zywiec sees no big 97 net rise .,
steven silber,
warsaw 1996-12-06,
"polish brewer zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said .",
"company president jean van boxmeer told reuters in an interview on friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround .",
"so far this year zywiec , whose full name is zaklady piwowarskie w zywcu sa , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys .",
it has produced 1.5 million hectolitres .,
van boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer .,
""" the perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , "" van boxmeer said on polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres .",
"he said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make poland , with its 40-million population , europe 's third largest beer market after germany and britain .",
"van boxmeer said poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors .",
zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by heineken while carlsberg has the same amount in okocim .,
"earlier this year south african breweries ltd ( sab ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted lech and tychy brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and australia 's brewpole bv has a controlling stake in poland 's larges t brewery , elbrewery company ltd. ( eb ) .",
"van boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins .",
he said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share .,
"but he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring czech republic .",
"some analysts say cheaper but high-quality czech imports could invade poland once tariffs for cefta countries are lifted in 1998 , but van boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the czech beer market 's overcapacity .",
""" i think polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and i 'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ...",
"i think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the czech beers , "" he said .",
"van boxmeer said zywiec had its eye on okocim , which has said it would start producing carlsberg beer next year , but that zywiec 's potential production of heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one .",
"he said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , zywiec full light , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand .",
""" you will not win the war of the polish beer market with imported international brands , "" van boxmeer said , adding that heineken would remain an up-market import in poland .",
van boxmeer also said zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made .,

the british government warned friday that it would refer the proposed trans-atlantic alliance between british airways plc and american airlines to britain 's monopolies and mergers commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions .,
"trade and industry secretary ian lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between britain and the united states to liberalise trans-atlantic air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes .",
"lang said he supported conditions proposed by britain 's office of fair trading , which was asked to examine the case last month .",
""" i agree ... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers , on those routes where ba and aa currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-atlantic market route between the uk and u.s. , "" he said .",
his comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in london with no deal signed .,
industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the british airways-american deal would be cleared .,
"the conditions for clearance of the alliance were that british airways and american drop 168 slots at london heathrow airport , the busiest in europe .",
"american 's parent , amr corp. , said it did not view the terms as a "" deal breaker . """,
"however , it called the conditions "" more severe "" than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances .",
"british airways 's initial response was that "" unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value . """,
"it added that it would be "" prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition . """,
"the government also wants british airways to drop a clause in its agreement with usair that bars it from competing on trans-atlantic routes , and said both british airways and american should be prepared to reduce services on the london to dallas-fort worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter .",

homestake mining co tops wall street 's list as the most likely white knight buyer for santa fe pacific gold corp if santa fe rejects unsolicited suitor newmont mining corp .,
"santa fe is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from newmont , announced thursday .",
"wall street , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between newmont and santa fe would be a "" bear hug , "" or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor .",
"newmont said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters .",
"analysts predict santa fe will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , newmont may not be able to match its offer .",
"they said the santa fe deal , which includes desirable nevada mining territory , would only payoff for newmont longer term .",
"newmont , in fact , will not benefit from the santa fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer .",
"any deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said .",
analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out barrick gold corp and bre-x minerals ltd as santa fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting indonesia 's busang vast gold deposit .,
"placer dome inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match santa fe 's nevada , south america and central asia presence , they said .",
a homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list .,
"homestake , based in san francisco , operates gold mines in the united states , australia , chile and canada .",
"earnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share , or $ 30.3 million , on revenues of $ 746.3 million .",
"santa fe is headquartered albuquerque , n.m. and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share , or $ 40 million , on revenues of $ 350 million .",
"santa fe has mining and exploration operations in nevada , california , montana , canada , brazil , australia , chile , kazakstan , mexico and ghana .",
"painewebber analyst marc cohen said he lowered his rating on newmont to neutral from attractive today because if newmont merged with santa fe , investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion .",
""" i think homestake could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above the newmont number .",
"one would have to outbid by at least 15 percent , but there is going to be a ( santa fe ) deal with someone , "" he said .",
""" longer term , two to three years out , ( a newmont-santa fe deal ) is positive , it does all the right things .",
"but in the near-term it is , at worst , neutral , "" the analyst added .",
newmont proposed to santa fe a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 newmont shares for each santa fe shares .,
"in friday new york stock exchange trade , newmonth was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while santa fe added 1/4 to 15-1/8 .",
""" newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with santa fe , which is almost always a euphemism for ' we have more money in our pocket , ' "" said an arb , referring to a possible sweetened bid from newmont .",

multinational commander going back to east zaire .,

nairobi 1996-12-06,
"the canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern zaire said on friday he was going back to zaire for more information about the plight of about 165,000 rwandan refugees adrift in the countryside .",
"lieutenant-general maurice baril told a news conference in nairobi his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of the eastern city of goma .",
"if he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew , he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees , even against the wishes of the government in kinshasa and the zairean rebels who control much of eastern zaire , he said .",
""" tomorrow i 'm going into rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern zaire and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground , "" he said .",
general baril saw rebel leader laurent kabila in goma last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the rwandan refugees have already gone home .,
"the rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground , for fear it might help the zairean army regain control of the area .",
"kinshasa opposes airdrops , apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters .",
canadian defence minister doug young said on thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way .,
""" it does n't look as though they ( airdrops ) are going to be required in any significant way because the ngos ( non-governmental organisations ) are in that area on the border between zaire and rwanda , "" young told reporters .",
but general baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information .,
""" we hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access ( to the large group of refugees ) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies .",
""" if they ca n't move because they are too weak , then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means ( airdrops ) ...it 's complex , it 's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary .",
"if it is necessary , i wo n't hesitate to use it , "" he said .",
"asked if he would disregard the objections of the zairean government , he said : "" it would have to be in the last resort .",
it would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger .,
do you think that i would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time ?,
"and my mandate is also under chapter seven to operate in eastern zaire . """,
"under chapter seven of the u.n. charter , the security council has wide powers to preserve peace and security .",
""" i know their ( the zairean government 's ) position and i know it 's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also , "" the general added .",
"he denied that his contacts , criticised by kinshasa , with the zairean rebels amounted to negotiations .",
""" i do n't negotiate , "" he said . """,
i coordinate with those who are holding ground and that 's a wise thing to do .,
"when we do n't know where the front is , we do n't know what the risk is . """,
"baril said that apart from the group of 150,000 , u.s. and british reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees -- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of masisi and one of up to 8,000 on the road from bukavu west to kindu .",
"the kisangani office of the medical charity medecins sans frontieres said on friday that more than 100,000 refugees were trekking northwest from the goma-bukavu area and many of them were now in the town of walikale .",
"the general did not mention these refugees , who are on the outer limit of the strip the planes have been checking .",

plastic surgery gets boost in brazil .,
simona de logu,
rio de janeiro 1996-12-06,
"plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on friday .",
"the number of plastic surgeries in brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in july 1994 , farid hakme , the president of the brazilian plastic surgery society ( sbcp ) , said .",
"the number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said .",
""" brazil ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons , the number of patients , number of operations , number of conferences .",
"our statistics are the highest for everything , "" hakme said .",
""" we believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market .",
"people need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in latin america 's economy . """,
"a controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery .",
"brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , ivo pitangy .",
"there are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the sbcp .",
"every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there .",
"hakme attributes brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . """,
"what happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , "" he said .",
"brazil 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each .",
"stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants .",
""" the women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the united states , "" sbcp vice-president oswaldo saldanha said . """,
"beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country . """,
plastic surgery scares like the case in which brazilian model claudia liz fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in october are not much of a deterrent .,
saldanha said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now .,

"the bishop will jointly receive the nobel award next tuesday with east timorese-born activist jose ramos horta , who lives in self-exile in australia .",

"will exacerbate the problem in finding a solution ( to east timor ) , "" alatas said on friday .",
he was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week 's ministerial meeting of the organisation of the islamic conference ( oic ) in jakarta .,
ramos horta has been a vocal leader of the opposition to jakarta 's rule in the territory .,
"belo and ramos horta were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of east timor , a former portuguese colony which indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year .",

"asked if the indonesian ambassador to norway would have attended the ceremony if only belo had been involved , alatas replied : "" probably , yes , but that is a hypothetical question . """,

"bill jordan , general secretary of the international confederation of free trade unions ( icftu ) , told a news conference the withdrawal of a wto invitation to ilo director general michel hansenne was "" outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world "" .",
jordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured world trade organisation ( wto ) officials to prevent hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links .,
""" it is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded ( to the pressure ) in silencing him , "" jordan said after the opening of an icftu conference on international labour standards and trade .",

jordan said the wto 's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour .,
"the icftu said it wanted the wto conference beginning on monday to outlaw forced and child labour , end discrimination in hiring , and guarantee the right to join a union .",
"bill brett , chairman of the ilo workers group , told reuters before the news conference he was "" not too surprised , but very disappointed "" that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn .",

"lahd , a 69-year-old former lebanese army major-general , heads the 3,000-strong sla militia which helps israel hold a border zone in south lebanon to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern israel .",
lahd said a few days after the trial began on february 16 that lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the jewish state .,
he said israel was capable of pressuring lebanon 's syrian-backed government to stop the legal pursuit .,
"the charges against lahd were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on israel 's side , helping israel strip off a part of lebanese territory by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping lebanese citizens for long periods .",
"shortly before lahd 's trial began , a beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former lebanese army soldiers with collaborating with israel .",
"no date has been set for the trial of the men , all members of the sla living in the israeli-held zone in south lebanon .",
israel and lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the sla -- a mixed christian-shi'ite moslem force -- which the jewish states regards as loyal allies .,
israel has said the lebanese army must incorporate the sla fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace .,
but lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against lahd .,
"former israeli prime minister shimon peres , calling lahd "" a great lebanese patriot "" , said earlier this year lebanon had insulted the sla commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges .",

"fourteen years after he bludgeoned and shot a man whose trailer home he robbed in 1982 , john mills jr .",
", 41 , was put to death in florida 's electric chair friday .",
"as glenn lawhon , a rural florida minister who is the victim 's father , looked on , mills was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. est ( 1213 gmt ) for the murder of lester lawhon .",
"speaking in arabic , mills made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body , said department of corrections spokesman eugene morris , who was present at the execution .",

mills is the 38th person to die in florida 's electric chair since the u.s. supreme court reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty .,
"prison officials said mills made no special request for a last meal and did not eat the steak , fried potatoes and orange juice offered him .",
"he spent thursday with family members and his spiritual adviser , morris said .",
mills was scheduled to die wednesday but had his sentence temporarily postponed by the florida supreme court .,
"on thursday , the 11th circuit u.s. court of appeals in atlanta denied his appeal in federal court .",
"in march 1982 , mills and accomplice michael frederick knocked on the door of lester lawhon 's trailer in an attempt to rob it , police said .",
lester lawhon was taken to a nearby airstrip where he was bludgeoned with a tire iron .,
mills then fired two shots that killed lawhon as the victim tried to run away .,
frederick is serving a 347-year sentence .,

he also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed .,

four african states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of u.n. secretary-general on friday now that boutros boutros-ghali has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election .,

it was not known if other candidates would step forward .,
"diplomats said general joseph garba of nigeria , a u.n. general assembly president in 1989-90 , was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country .",
boutros-ghali on wednesday opened the door for other africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race .,
his supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse .,
the united states on nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 security council members supported him .,
"the move by the african states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week , a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee .",
the security council has to vote on a new secretary-general and then seek the endorsement of the 185-members general assembly before december 31 when boutros-ghali 's term expires .,

singapore 1996-12-06,
"singapore 's winning campaign to host the world trade organisation ( wto ) 's first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , the lifeblood of its economy , analysts said .",
""" as one of the world 's most externally oriented economies , singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the wto , "" said desmond supple , economist at research house i.d.e.a .",
""" singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product . """,
"the city-state met u.s. opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from december 9 to 13 .",
"in a stand some analysts linked to controversy over singapore 's caning of an american teenager for vandalism , then-u.s. trade representative mickey kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the wto was going to be headquartered .",
that would have meant geneva .,
but singapore had the support of other wto members .,
"derek da cunha , senior fellow at the institute of policy studies ( iseas ) , said singapore 's hosting of the conference "" carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe . """,
"there is the international prestige singapore would enjoy , but "" more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market "" , said tan kong yam , head of business policy at the national university of singapore .",
"at the ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review the work of the wto and the implementation of the uruguay round free trade commitments under its predecessor the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) .",
"in june , the wto hailed singapore for its open market policies but the european union and other trading powers called on singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector .",
supple said the struggle that singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks .,
""" there is tension at every step of the way , "" since a battle line between the west and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said .",
"supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for singapore , "" however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . """,
"from a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for singapore 's tourism industry , tan said .",
"a large part of singapore 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average singaporean "" would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , "" tan said .",
""" but the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for singapore as a small economy . """,
supple said any political gains the singapore government would get from the wto meeting -- ahead of a general election due by april 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda .,
""" if there are any movements toward freer trade , then singapore 's economy and the electorate would gain , "" he said . """,
